# Martains-Order-Mod
Some random notes: This mod aims to add a bit of everything, other bigger mods were a great inspiration for me to start developing with the little I knew of coding and drawing. I have a thread posted about my mod; https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/last-heros-mod-martains-order.104722/
There is also a discord server invitation on the forum. The github of this mod does not have all it's content, everthing else must be asked for by private messaging.
Have fun with the mod!
