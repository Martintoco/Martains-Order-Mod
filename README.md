# Martains-Order-Mod
Some random notes: This mod aims to add a bit of everything, other bigger mods were a great inspiration for me to start developing with the little I know of coding and drawing. I have a thread posted about my mod; https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/martains-order-mod.99634/ 
There is also my discord server invitation there, so we can chat about some improvments or ideas about the mod!
Hope ya'll like it!
